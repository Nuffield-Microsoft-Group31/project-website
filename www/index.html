            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>UCL Active is a platform developed by UCL that will collect data, process it and share it. Our team is working on dashboards for both corporate and personal users that will display their acheivements and plans. It will also use machine learning to give accurate predictions for reaching goals set by the user.</p>
            <h2>Background and Context</h2>
            <p>We will be working in collaboration with Nuffield Health Hospital and Microsoft. Nuffield Health Hospital is a private health centre which provides variety of services such as Physiotherapy, Health Assessments, Emotional Wellbeing and even Gym facilities. We will be equipped and fully supported by Microsoft to deliver additional and innovative services to Nuffield Health’s clients and professionals. Furthermore, we will be working closely with the Digital Assistance team and Diana a 3rd year Computer Science student to deliver the final product. </p>
            <p>The project will be split into two phases. Phase one of the project will be dedicated to creation of requirements and research, identifying strategies and the correct technologies, development of R&D experiments, architecture designs, development of experiments that will lead to our PoC design(s) and to build one or more prototypes. The second phase will largely be based on implementation and the core development of the functionalities of the platform.</p>
            <p>The initial problem that we are tackling is to be able to create a user friendly and informative data visualisation both for Nuffield Health clients and their professionals to. The platform for their clients will consist of interactive and attractive visualisation of their own data to help them make better and more informative decisions for their lifestyle. Additionally, we would like the system to give recommendations to the users to improve their health. The platform for the professional will consist of data visualisation of all the relevant information of their clients, to spot trends and tendencies to make their services even better. Furthermore, we will be using Machine Learning with the help of Microsoft to perform analysis based on gym attendance to improve the attendance of their clients. </p>

              <h1>Technologies & Research</h1>
              <p>In this section we will be going in depth about the specific research done for the choice of our technolgies and platforms.</p>

              <h3>Microsoft Platforms</h3>
              <p>Collaborating with Microsoft has enabled us to use many tools and platforms for our project. We will be using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for our version control alongside other useful features such as measuring and reporting tools. Additionally we will be using Microsoft Azure which enables us to handle most of our back-end systems, such as the implementation of Authorisation, Messaging queue (Azure queue) and database systems. Microsoft Azure will enable us to collaborate closely and makes it easier to link different parts of the project together.  Furthermore, we will be using Azure Machine Learning platform to perform data analysis as part of our project.</p>

              <h3>Database Systems</h3>
              <p>For Most projects there will always be a requirement of storing and transfer of data and for our project this isn’t an exception. We will be storing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FIHR) messages. It uses JSON or XML for data representation and its goal is to facilitate interoperation between healthcare systems, so that it is easier to deliver heath care information to healthcare providers and individuals. </p>

              <p>For our project we will need both a SQL and a NoSQL database. We will be using a SQL database from azure to store all the information of clients and to be able to easily access these data for data visualisation. However, a NoSQL database is also required which will enable us to have rapid and analysis of large volumes, different data types. They provide scalability, availability and fault tolerance which seek to solve big data performance issues that a relational databases (SQL) weren’t designed to address.</p>

              <p>As there are many options for database choices we researched the two most popular NoSQL options, MongoDB and Cassandra. We researched the advantages and disadvantages of the two and the differences between them such as one being “Column-based” and the other “Document-based” and came to a conclusion which would be the most suitable for our development. In the end we decided to proceed with MongoDB as it had clear advantages which specifically addressed our needs and it gave us the flexibility of launching MongoDB on Azure. You can read more about the specifics below.</p>

              <h3>Messaging Queues and Event Hubs</h3>

              <h3>Authorisation</h3>

              <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
              <p>An integral part of our project will be based on creation of visualisation for both client and corporate use. Visualisation enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually which makes grasping complex and large data easier. With interactive data visualisation you are able to give the user access to drill down in more specific details that they require to find out how they are processed. Furthermore, an attractive data visualisation can help motivate users and it can also help users to identify areas that need attention and improvement.</p>

              <p>To do this we have decided to use the platform D3.js. D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. As stated from the D3.js website d3js.org “D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combing powerful visualisation components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.”  Therefore, D3 is by far the best choice for our application, since it uses a functional style we are able to reuse code and add specific function to our content with great flexibility on the style and the interactive of our data.</p>

              <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
              <p>Machine learning was born from pattern matching and based on the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks. The theory is all about if a machine is able to learn from data that is provided by it using smart algorithms. For this project we will be using the Azure Machine Learning platform to train data about gym attendance of Nuffield Health. By doing so we hope to gain useful information where than we can provide to both the clients and corporate users valuable and beneficial information. For example by building precise models, an organisation such as Nuffield Health Hospital has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities or avoiding unknown risks.</p>
