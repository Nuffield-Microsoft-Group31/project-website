            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>UCL Active is a platform developed by UCL that will collect data, process it and share it. Our team is working on dashboards for both corporate and personal users that will display their acheivements and plans. It will also use machine learning to give accurate predictions for reaching goals set by the user.</p>
            <h2>Background and Context</h2>
            <p>We will be working in collaboration with Nuffield Health Hospital and Microsoft. Nuffield Health Hospital is a private health centre which provides variety of services such as Physiotherapy, Health Assessments, Emotional Wellbeing and even Gym facilities. We will be equipped and fully supported by Microsoft to deliver additional and innovative services to Nuffield Health's clients and professionals. Furthermore, we will be working closely with the Digital Assistance team and Diana a 3rd year Computer Science student to deliver the final product. </p>
            <p>The project will be split into two phases. Phase one of the project will be dedicated to creation of requirements and research, identifying strategies and the correct technologies, development of R&D experiments, architecture designs, development of experiments that will lead to our PoC design(s) and to build one or more prototypes. The second phase will largely be based on implementation and the core development of the functionalities of the platform.</p>
            <p>The initial problem that we are tackling is to be able to create a user friendly and informative data visualisation both for Nuffield Health clients and their professionals to. The platform for their clients will consist of interactive and attractive visualisation of their own data to help them make better and more informative decisions for their lifestyle. Additionally, we would like the system to give recommendations to the users to improve their health. The platform for the professional will consist of data visualisation of all the relevant information of their clients, to spot trends and tendencies to make their services even better. Furthermore, we will be using Machine Learning with the help of Microsoft to perform analysis based on gym attendance to improve the attendance of their clients. </p>

              <h1>Specification</h1>
              <p>Our team has decided to use the Agile software development practice. Agile development excels at reducing risk by creating software in short timeframes. Agile is usually done in iterations or sprints, where each iteration is usually 1-4 weeks long. The intent of these iterations is to develop software and/or features which will have functionality at the end of the short timeframe. Within each iteration, the development life cycle of requirements gathering, design, development, testing and documentation is prepared as if it is treated like a small sub-project. Because of these decisions, only an overall set of requirements will be presented bellow, rather than specific in-depth details. Those will be agreed on at every sprint.</p>

              <p>George has not been to the gym in a while. He is also considering giving up altogether and not extending his membership. The app detects that his behavioural patterns show he is very likely to stop attending and not consider returning. It notifies him and reminds him that he is not achieving his goals. Once he opens his app, his goal is displayed along with his progress and he is suggested a gym session to catch up. He reluctantly decides to pay his local gym another visit and slowly regains his motivation to continue. He ends up extending his membership.</p>

          <div class="container-fluid">
              <h1>Technologies & Research</h1>
              <p>In this section we will be going in depth about the specific research done for the choice of our technolgies and platforms.</p>

              <h3>Microsoft Platforms</h3>
              <p>Collaborating with Microsoft has enabled us to use many tools and platforms for our project. We will be using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for our version control alongside other useful features such as measuring and reporting tools. Additionally we will be using Microsoft Azure which enables us to handle most of our back-end systems, such as the implementation of Authorisation, Messaging queue (Azure queue) and database systems. Microsoft Azure will enable us to collaborate closely and makes it easier to link different parts of the project together.  Furthermore, we will be using the Azure Machine Learning platform to perform data analysis as part of our project.</p>

              <h3>Database Systems</h3>
              <p>For Most projects there will always be a requirement of storing and transfer of data and for our project this isn't an exception. We will be storing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FIHR) messages. It uses JSON or XML for data representation and its goal is to facilitate interoperation between healthcare systems. That way, it is easier to deliver heath care information to healthcare providers and individuals. </p>

              <p>For our project we will need both an SQL and a NoSQL database. We will be using a SQL database from Azure to store all the information of clients and to be able to easily access this data for visualisation. However, a NoSQL database is also required. It will enable us to have rapid analysis of large volumes of different data types. They provide scalability, availability and fault tolerance which seek to solve big data performance issues that a relational databases (SQL) isn't designed to address.</p>

              <p>As there are many options for database choices we researched the two most popular NoSQL options, MongoDB and Cassandra. We researched the advantages and disadvantages of the two. The differences, such as one being "Column-based" and the other "Document-based" lead to a conclusion of which would be the most suitable for our development. In the end we decided to proceed with MongoDB as it had clear advantages which specifically addressed our needs and it gave us the flexibility of launching MongoDB on Azure. You can read more about the specifics in <a href='#rdocs'>the Documents section bellow.</a></p>

              <h3>Messaging Queues and Event Hubs</h3>

              <p>Message queuing is a communication system used by different processes. In its simple form it is a first-in, first-out data structure of messages (of various formats). The data is being published by publishing processes (publishers) and retrieved by consuming processes (consumers). </p>

              <p>For the requirements of this project, we will need a message queuing service that could handle a large amount of messages being sent. In addition to its basic functionality, we will need to make data accessible only to consumers previously specified by the publisher. Additionally, all the data sent over the service will be stored in the NoSQL database.</p>

              <p>Two solutions were proposed. The first one was to use the Event Hubs service which provides most of the specified functionalities. The other one was the Azure Queue, which is a simple message queuing service with lower capabilities and fewer features. Although Event Hubs would be convenient to use, they are designed to hold a bigger amount of messages we could ever expect to be sent through this app. The additional features do not justify their costliness since they can be simulated by e.g. using multiple messaging queues.</p>

              <p>A possible alternative to the Azure Queue implementation would be an open source tool rabbitMQ. While its capabilities are similar to the capabilities of Azure Queue. However, we have decided to use Azure Queues as they are easy to manage within the Azure portal. You can read more about the specifics in <a href='#rdocs'>the Documents section bellow.</a></p>

              <h3>Authentication</h3>

              <p>Authentication is a process that ensures and confirms a userâ€™s identity. Since access control is normally based on the identity of the user who requests access to a resource or a service, authentication is essential to effective security.</p>

              <p>OAuth is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications. It is used as a way for Internet users to log in to third party websites through an access token mechanism, using their accounts at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, etc.â€”but without exposing their password.</p>

              <p>In this project we use OAuth in conjunction with Azure Active Directory - Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. It is a powerful identity and access management service (IDaaS) for on-premises and cloud-based apps and provides administrators with the ability to manage end user identities and access privileges.</p>

              <p>In order to use Active Directory, we had to register the application with the service, obtain the application Redirect URI, determine whether we were building a web or native application. A registered application is uniquely identified within the directory. You can read more about the specifics in <a href='#rdocs'>the Documents section bellow.</a></p>

              <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
              <p>An integral part of our project will be based on creation of visualisation for both client and corporate use. Visualisation enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually which makes grasping complex and large data easier. With interactive data visualisation you are able drill down in more specific details that require to find out how they are processed. Furthermore, an attractive data visualisation can help motivate users. It can also help users identify areas that need attention and improvement.</p>

              <p>To do this we have decided to use the platform D3.js. This is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. As stated from the D3.js website (d3js.org), â€œD3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combing powerful visualisation components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation."  Therefore, D3 is by far the best choice for our application, since it uses a functional style we are able to reuse code and add specific function to our content with great flexibility on the style and the interactive of our data.</p>

              <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
              <p>Machine learning was born from pattern matching and based on the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks. The theory is all about if a machine is able to learn from data that is provided by it using smart algorithms. For this project we will be using the Azure Machine Learning platform and train it using data about gym attendance of Nuffield Health. By doing so we hope to gain useful information where than we can provide to both the clients and corporate users valuable and beneficial information. By building precise models, an organisation such as Nuffield Health Hospital has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities or avoiding unknown risks. You can read more about the specifics in <a href='#rdocs'>the Documents section bellow.</a></p>

              <h3>Testing & Automation</h3>
              <p>Weâ€™ve investigated testing tools that are adapted to the technologies we use in our project. A very suitable tool is the Azure Diagnostics functionality. It enables us to monitor requests and connections by gathering data about the activity that is generated. This would let us monitor the performance of the service from a customer perspective, and is also a major source of data for the Corporate version of our product.</p>

              <p>Azure Diagnostics is functionality that needs to be configured on the different cloud services and virtual machines we make use of. We are interested in this tool because it enables us to test the robustness of the connections we make use of between queues and databases. This is done by collecting data and statistics on requests and connections related, web pages and services. Azure Diagnostics is particularly interesting because it is able to reduce the testing scope: it enables isolation of a service that is part of the product.</p>

              <p>We also see testing as something that relates the userâ€™s experience and how it reacts to the application's behaviour. We believe that using the expertise in Behavioural Science from the Oxford PhD student would allow us to test if the application fulfils itâ€™s psychological impact of motivation, progression and motivation. This could for example be done by showing users different ways of displaying health data and analysing their perception of the dashboard.

              <p>We identify opportunities for automation, notably within testing. By using the targeted functionality of Diagnostics testing, we can automate test cases that are executed repeatedly and that are business critical. For example, making sure that the number of client connections to the system is coherent with the attendance data. This would allow us to garantee continuous data integrity. We also see space for automation in the process of performing back-ups of client data. This would collect all the copies of the data in a server automatically. Deletion of older back-up files that have exceeded an arbitrary time limit can also be automated</p>
