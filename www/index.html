            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>UCL Active is a platform developed by UCL that will collect data, process it and share it. Our team is working on dashboards for both corporate and personal users that will display their acheivements and plans. It will also use machine learning to give accurate predictions for reaching goals set by the user.</p>
            <h2>Background and Context</h2>
            <p>We will be working in collaboration with Nuffield Health Hospital and Microsoft. Nuffield Health Hospital is a private health centre which provides variety of services such as Physiotherapy, Health Assessments, Emotional Wellbeing and even Gym facilities. We will be equipped and fully supported by Microsoft to deliver additional and innovative services to Nuffield Health’s clients and professionals. Furthermore, we will be working closely with the Digital Assistance team and Diana a 3rd year Computer Science student to deliver the final product. </p>
            <p>The project will be split into two phases. Phase one of the project will be dedicated to creation of requirements and research, identifying strategies and the correct technologies, development of R&D experiments, architecture designs, development of experiments that will lead to our PoC design(s) and to build one or more prototypes. The second phase will largely be based on implementation and the core development of the functionalities of the platform.</p>
            <p>The initial problem that we are tackling is to be able to create a user friendly and informative data visualisation both for Nuffield Health clients and their professionals to. The platform for their clients will consist of interactive and attractive visualisation of their own data to help them make better and more informative decisions for their lifestyle. Additionally, we would like the system to give recommendations to the users to improve their health. The platform for the professional will consist of data visualisation of all the relevant information of their clients, to spot trends and tendencies to make their services even better. Furthermore, we will be using Machine Learning with the help of Microsoft to perform analysis based on gym attendance to improve the attendance of their clients. </p>

Through research will be done by each member for different segments of the project to identify relevant new technologies, feasibility, complexity and risk. Furthermore, the architecture design as well as the appropriate software engineering principles will be decided at this stage and confirmed by the client.</p>

There will be a creation of experiment logs that will include specific experiments for different features and components of the platform that is being developed.
